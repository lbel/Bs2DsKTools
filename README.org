* Intro
Just a collection of tools and classes for the Bs⁰ → DsK/Dsπ analysis.
The different tree readers, =readMCTree=, =readDataTree= and
=lifetime= inherit from a purely virtual class, =readTree=. There are
several overloaded =readTree::Loop()= methods for different types of
output.

_Studies:_
1. Bs⁰ time acceptance
2. Bs⁰ and bachelor particle opening angle as PID


* Classes
_Tree reader:_
+ Inherits from purely virtual =readTree=
+ =readDataTree= reads data ntuples
+ =readMCTree= reads Monte Carlo ntuples
+ =lifetime= reads Monte Carlo ntuples for lifetime acceptance studies

_Opening angle:_
=oanglePID= implements a DLL like PID variable from opening angle


* Utilities
+ =accept.cc=: an utility to select events using the =lifetime= tree
  reader for lifetime acceptance studies
+ =resolution.cc=: make residual and pull plots from Monte Carlo
+ =ltFit.py=: fit for the trigger lifetime acceptance function

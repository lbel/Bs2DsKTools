* Intro
Just a collection of tools for the Bs⁰ → DsK analysis. All the
separate tools are modularised in sub-directories. The different tree
readers, ~readMCTree~ and ~readDataTree~, inherit from a purely
virtual ~readTree~ class. There are several overlaoded ~Loop()~
methods for different types of output.

Tools:
1. Bs⁰ time acceptance
2. Bs⁰ and bachelor particle opening angle as PID
